It provides functionality to create, read, update, and delete appointments as well as creating, reading, updating and
deleting customers. Other that that functionality, it provides 3 different reports that gives an analytical overview as to what
type of appointments are being scheduled, by who, and where those people live.

Development Environment:
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA
- SDK: Java SDK Version 18

our customers live and how we can better serve them based on their location.
