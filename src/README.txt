This is a desktop application written in Java to allow employees to schedule appointments for customers.
It provides functionality to create, read, update, and delete appointments as well as creating, reading, updating and
deleting customers. Other that that functionality, it provides 3 different reports that gives an analytical overview as to what
type of appointments are being scheduled, by who, and where those people live.

Development Environment:
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA 2022.1.3 (Community Edition)
- SDK: Java SDK Version 18
- JavaFX Version - JavaFX-SDK-18.0.1

Additional Report:
The additional report shows how many customers exist in each division. This is useful for helping us understand where
our customers live and how we can better serve them based on their location.
